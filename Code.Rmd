# Design a set of distributions/models under both proportional-hazard and non-proportional-hazard assumptions
## proportional-hazard
The Cox proportional hazards model does not assume a particular baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ but the proportional relation between groups and baseline.
$$
h_i(t) = h_0(t) \exp[\beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p X_{ip}]
$$


## non-proportional-hazard
The Weibull proportional hazards model assumes a specific functional form for the hazard rate, which can either increase or decrease over time. Its shape parameter distinctly describes whether the hazard rate is increasing, decreasing, or constant.
$$
h_i(t) = \lambda \gamma t^{\gamma - 1} \exp[\beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \ldots + \beta_p X_{ip}]
$$
where $\lambda$ is the scale parameter, and $\gamma$ is the shape parameter.
